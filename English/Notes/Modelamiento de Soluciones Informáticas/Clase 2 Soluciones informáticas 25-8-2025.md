## Importance of IGR
- Reduce the gap between:  
  - What you think  
  - What is said  
  - What is done

## Requirements Analysis
Engineers must be able to:
1. **Understand** user needs (explicit and implicit).  
2. **Document** needs accurately and concisely.  
3. **Validate** that the requirements are understood and can be met.

## Key Aspects

| Type of requirement | Description | Example |          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| **Functional Requirements** | They represent the specific actions that the system must perform.       | The system must allow users to create and modify profiles | **The what** |
| **NON-functional requirements** | They define system attributes, such as performance, usability, and security. | The system must be capable of concurrently handling at least 100 users without performance degradation. | **The How** |
| **Interface Requirements** | They specify how the system interacts with other systems or components | The system must integrate with an external authentication system.                                             | **The Form** |
| **Data Requirements** | They describe the characteristics of the data that the system will handle | The system must store user information, including name, email and registration date | **The Background** |

## Requirements Analysis Process
1. Compile needs and expectations of stakeholders.  
2. Record information with appropriate tools.  
3. Review and refine requirements (eliminate ambiguities, conflicts, redundancies).  
4. Verify that the requirements are understandable, complete and coherent.

## Requirements Elicitation Techniques
1. Interviews  
2. Surveys  
3. Brainstorming sessions  
4. Functional decomposition  
5. Process modeling  
6. Domain modeling  
7. User Stories

### Advantages of Surveys
1. Reaches a large and diverse sample.  
2. Collect quantitative and qualitative data.  
3. They are administered online, mail, telephone or in person.  
4. They allow anonymity → more honest answers.  
5. They are standardized and consistent.  

### Disadvantages of Surveys
1. Low response rates → affects reliability.  
2. Wording and formatting can introduce confusion.  
3. Difficult to capture context and complexity of requirements.  
4. Requires experience for valid and reliable design.  
5. Biases (self-selection, social desirability, etc.).  

---

### Brainstorming Challenges
1. Conversations dominated by extroverts.  
2. Anchoring effect: focus on first ideas.  
3. Awkward silences when there is no preparation.  

### Brainstorming Strategies
- **Starbursting**: Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why?, How?  
- **5 Whys**  
- **SWOT Analysis**  
- **How-Now-Wow Matrix**  
- **Factor analysis (causes of the problem)**  
- **Mind maps**  
- **Gap analysis**  

---

## Domain Modeling
- Describes the domain types and their restrictions in an organization.  
- It is composed of **atomic domains** → abstract data types with constraints.  

---

## Requirements Documentation- Use of **acceptance criteria** (Scrum).  
- Reference: [Cómo escribir criterios de aceptación](https://scrum.menzinsky.com/2015/10/como-escribir-los-criterios-de.html).  

---

## Requirements Validation
- Ensure that they are complete, consistent and verifiable.  
- Support guide: [Documento de Requerimientos de Software](https://www.pmoinformatica.com/2018/04/documento-de-requerimientos-de-software_37.html).

## Project (EVA1 – 20%)
Each team must:
1. Develop and apply a **complete requirements gathering protocol**.  
2. Use the material seen in classes.  
3. Submit a **Requirements Report** (20% of the grade).
