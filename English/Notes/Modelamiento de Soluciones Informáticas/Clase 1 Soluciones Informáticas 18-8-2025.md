# INTRODUCTION TO UML

- Request for something that is considered necessary, especially from an authority. It can be defined as **Necessary Attribute**, which is **useful** to clients or end users.

- Description of a **Condition or capacity that a system must meet.**

## Example:

**What you think:** "I need you to build a fun, simple and functional swing in a tree at my house"
**What it says:** "I need you to build a swing, on a tree in my house, that allows my whole family to sit and watch the sunset, that is beautiful, original, cheap, comfortable and fun"

## Why is IGR important?

It is important because:

1. Software has to meet the needs of users.
2. Avoid changes in requirements during software development.
3. Reduces the risk of failure.

In systems engineering, Requirements Management includes:

1. All tasks related to determining needs.
2. Satisfy what software needs.
3. Various requirements of the Stakeholders.
4. Achieve an **Optimal state.**

It has to be measurable, verifiable, without ambiguities or contradictions.

Software engineering disciplines

Process Disciplines Business Modeling/Implementation Requirements/Testing Analysis and Design/Deployment

Supporting disciplines Environment Configuration and change control, Project management


| Process Disciplines | **Business modeling, implementation** | Requirements, Test analysis | Design, Deployment |

| **Disciplines of** **Support** | **Atmosphere** | **Configuration and change control** | **Project management** |
## RUP
UML software development process, most used standard methodology for analysis
## CMMI
Global certification to measure an organization's maturity in software design and development
## SWEBOK
#### (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge)
Knowledge that exists in the software engineering discipline

## Requirements Specification

1. Condition to solve a problem or achieve an objective

2. Condition that must be met by a system to satisfy a contract

3. Documented representation of a condition or capability.

## Type of Requirements

1. Requirements of Interested Parties (Stakeholders)
2. Solution Requirements (for business purposes)
3. Transition (or start-up) requirements
4. Functional Requirements (**What** actions the system must perform and **what** results it must provide)
5. Non-functional Requirements (They do not define what the system should do, but rather **how** it should do it)

###### **Functional** requirements must be SMART

- (**S**specific) They must clearly define what the system should do
- (**M**easurable) Be quantified or measured
- (**A**chievable) Possible to implement
- (**R**ealistic) important for users
- (**T**ime-bound) Alienated from deadlines and objectives.

## Identification of problems, opportunities and objectives

- Objectively observe what happens in a company. 
- Detect problems and opportunities.
- Identify objectives (what you are trying to achieve)
