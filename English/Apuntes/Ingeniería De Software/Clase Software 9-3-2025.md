### What is the importance of software development models and methodologies?

Ensure that _software_ products meet user requirements and expectations.

### Software quality standards (ISO/IEC 12207)

International framework that defines the processes necessary to develop and maintain systems.

Introduced in 1995, with the most recent version in 2017. Provides a ==common structure for lifecycle processes==.

### Structure of ISO/IEC 12207

| Agreement processes | Technical processes | Enabling processes | Technical management processes |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acquisition and supply activities establish agreements between the supplier and the acquirer. | Requirements, design, implementation, integration, testing, installation, operation, maintenance and retirement of the software. | Life cycle, infrastructure management, portfolio, human resources, quality and knowledge | Planning, evaluation, control, decisions, risks, configuration, information, measurement and quality. |
### Application of ISO/IEC 12207

From conception and development to maintenance and product retirement. Flexible and can adapt to different types of projects and organizations.

##### Advantages:

| Quality improvement | Risk management | Communication and collaboration | Compliance with requirements |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It provides a structured framework to ensure that all necessary activities are carried out consistently and efficiently. | Helps identify and manage risks throughout the software lifecycle. | Facilitates better communication and collaboration between all parties involved in the project. | Ensures that the software meets user requirements and expectations. |

### SOFTWARE Engineering Fundamentals
---
Discipline that focuses on the design, development, maintenance and management of high-quality software systems. They include principles such as abstraction, modularity, encapsulation, and software reuse. These principles help manage complexity and improve software quality
### Stages of general systems theory in the SOFTWARE engineering process
---
Provides a conceptual framework for understanding and managing the complexity of software systems. The stages associated with this theory in the process include| Problem variables | Activities over time | System behavior | System structure |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elements that affect the behavior of a system and must be considered in its analysis and design | A sequence of actions performed during the software life cycle to transform inputs into outputs | How a system acts or behaves in response to internal or external stimuli | An organization and arrangement of the components of a system and the relationships between them |

### SOFTWARE development models and methodologies
---
[[Software Class 8-27-2025]]
There are several models and methodologies, each with its own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common include:

| Cascade model | Agile methodology | Incremental model |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linear and sequential approach where each phase depends on the successful completion of the previous phase | Flexible and collaborative approach that relies on incremental delivery and rapid response to changes | Linear and sequential approach where each phase depends on the successful completion of the previous phase |

| Model | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cascade methodology** | Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.                          | - Clarity in each phase | - Not very flexible, the requirement has to be formal.                                                                                  |
| **Agile methodology** | Flexible and fast delivery of functional software increments. Scrum and Kanban. | - High flexibility | -High customer participation.                                                                                                         || **Incremental methodology** | Sequential model, developed in stages.                                  | - Define requirements and incremental power. It is used in fast software, giving system improvements | -Having no limit, it will not reach an end. Improvement increments; the second increment could not work, having to start from scratch |

### Reference framework associated with SOFTWARE development
---
It includes principles and standards that ensure the quality of the solution to be developed. They provide guidance for process management, continuous improvement and quality assurance, resulting in more reliable, efficient and maintainable software.


> [!NOTE] Scrum
> Based on short work cycles (sprints).
> 
> It is applied under the assumption that there is a unit that controls and directs; It could be management. Management must be vigilant during the short run.
>
> Every day the team holds a short meeting (fifteen minutes), called a scrum, where the team discusses what they will do the next day.


> [!NOTE] Kanban
> Visualization and management of the workflow. Its main objective is to optimize processes, reduce delivery time and improve the quality of products or services.


> [!NOTE] XP
> Focuses on software quality and customer satisfaction through short development cycles and frequent releases.
> 
> The XP methodology starts with four values:
> Communication
> Feedback
> Simplicity
> Courage
