| Century | Software development |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| XX | In this, a standardization of software development was sought, defining a methodology that sought to build programs. In this, there was a crisis, emerging several structured methods. UML and consolidation of methodologies have arrived |
| XXI | Mastery of agile methodologies and digital transformation |

| Keywords | Definition |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Life cycle** | Set of phases that software goes through from its conception to its retirement. Requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance |
| **Software Quality** | Meets your requirements and expectations. Includes attributes such as functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability and portability |
| **Maintenance and evolution of the software** | Activities necessary to correct errors, improve performance and adapt to new requirements. This can be corrective, adaptive, perfective or preventive |
#### Fundamentals of Software Engineering

| Basic Principles | Definition |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abstraction** | Simplification of software.                                                                                   |
| **Modularity** | Division of the **software** into components, facilitating the development, maintenance and compression of the **software** |
| **Encapsulation** | Data protection and functionality within specific modules.                                            |

| Process and practices | Definition |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Software development models** | Waterfall, agile, spiral model. Each model has its advantages and disadvantages. Depends on the project and requirements |
| **Software Project Management** | Planning, monitoring and control of project activities. Management of resources, time, cost, quality, risks and communication |

| Tools and techniques | Definition || --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CASE Tools** | Supports the development and maintenance of other software systems. Tools for modeling, design, coding, testing and project management |
| **Modeling and design techniques** | Use of diagrams and models to represent the structure and behavior of software. Flowcharts, entity-relationship, classes, |
## Selection of methodologies or life cycles

### Big Project:
==Require more detailed planning and management. They can also benefit from greater modularity and component reuse.==
It could be the implementation of a business management system for an external client, applying general systems theory to manage complexity and ensure quality.
### Small Project:
==Simple and quick to develop.==
It could be the development of an internal mobile application using principles of modularity and encapsulation.
### Internal Project:
Developed for use within the organization.
### External Project:
Clients or external users. They may have stricter requirements and higher quality expectations.

## Criteria for selection

### Project complexity:
They can benefit from more structured methodologies that provide greater control and monitoring.
### Customer requirements:
Client needs and expectations influence the choice of methodology.
### Deadlines and available resources
The availability of time and resources is also a crucial factor. Projects with tight deadlines can benefit from agile methodologies that promote incremental and rapid deliveries.

## Methodologies

| Model | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Agile methodology** | Flexible and fast delivery of functional software increments. Scrum and Kanban. | - High flexibility | -High customer engagement |
| **Cascade methodology** | Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.                          | - Clarity in each phase | - Not very flexible |
| **Hybrid methodology** | Agile practices for development, waterfall for planning and documentation.   | - Adaptability | - Complexity in implementation |

## Importance of general systems theory in software engineering
  
General systems theory provides a conceptual framework that enables software engineers to understand and manage the complexity of software systems.


| Keywords | Definition |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Requirements** | User needs and expectations |
| **Technical restrictions** | Limitations imposed by the technology used.                     |
| **Environmental factors** | External conditions that influence the development and operation of software |
## What are activities in time?

| Keywords | Definition |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || **Requirements analysis** | identification and documentation of user needs and environmental conditions.                          |
| **Design** | Creation of the software architecture and definition of its components and interfaces.                              |
| **Implementation** | Source code development and software construction |
| **Tests** | Verification and validation of the software to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.                   |
| **Deployment** | Installation and configuration of the software in the production environment.                                               |
| **Maintenance** | Updating and improving the software after its deployment to fix errors and adapt to new requirements. |
