### Importance of _software_ development models and methodologies

Fundamental to organize, manage and execute _software_ projects efficiently.
#### Waterfall
Linear and sequential approach in which the stages of _software_ development are carried out sequentially.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clear and easy to understand structure.                             | Not very flexible in the face of changes in requirements.               |
| It is good for projects with well-defined and stable requirements. | Risk of discovering problems late in the process |
| Facilitates project management and documentation | Not suitable for complex and long-term projects |
### Agile methodology
**flexible and collaborative approach** based on incremental delivery and rapid response to changes.

### Types of agile methodologies

| Scrum | Kanban | Extreme programming (XP) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Based on short work cycles (sprints).<br><br>It is applied under the assumption that there is a unit that controls and directs; It could be management. Management must be attentive during the sprint.<br><br>Every day the team holds a short meeting (fifteen minutes), called a scrum, where the team discusses what they will do the next day. | Visualization and management of workflow. Its main objective is to optimize processes, reduce delivery time and improve the quality of products or services. | It focuses on software quality and customer satisfaction through short development cycles and frequent releases.<br><br>The XP methodology starts with four values:<br><br>- Communication<br>- Feedback<br>- Simplicity<br>- Courage<br> |
### Incremental methodology
Sequential model, but what differentiates it from the rest is that it takes the basic principles of the sequential and develops them in stages. In this way, as progress is made, results are obtained, sorts of beta versions of the final software product.The customer uses the core product and based on their evaluation a plan is developed for the next increment

### Phases of the incremental model

| Requirements analysis | Design | Implementation | Tests |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Gathering requirements. | Creation of high-level design. | Source code development Verification and validation | Verification and validation |
