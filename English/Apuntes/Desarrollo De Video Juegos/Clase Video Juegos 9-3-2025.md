## Video Game Development: Necessary Elements

### Importance
- Video games surpass music and Hollywood combined in income.  
- They are present on PC, consoles, mobile phones and VR.  
- There are multiple markets: AAA, casual, educational, gamification.  

---

## Software Crisis
- Emerges in the 70s.  
- Problem: high demand + increasing complexity + lack of methodologies.  
- Result: unreliable and difficult to validate software.  

---

## Validation
- Guarantee that the system meets regulations and specifications.  
- Improves productivity, reliability and safety.  
- Covers software, hardware and integration with devices.

## Software Quality
| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Definition | Set of qualities that determine usefulness and existence. |
| Features | Efficiency, flexibility, reliability, maintainability, portability, usability, security, integrity. |
| Importance | Quality should be evaluated throughout the life cycle, not just at the end. |

## From Project to Software
- Principles: development methodologies (Waterfall, Scrum, Kanban), quality criteria, models and diagrams.  
- Before methodologies → define the **base project**.  
- Key factors: budget, equipment, art, portability, game genre.

2. **Proposal** → document with:  
   - High Concept (phrase that defines the game).  
   - Pillars (central characteristics).  
   - Market and financial study (feasibility, ROI).  
   - Game mechanics.  
   - Artistic vision (color palettes, style).  
   - Narrative vision (story, characters).  
   - Technical vision (technologies and tools).  
3. **Prototype** → playable version to test gameplay and technology.  

### Production
| Phase | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **First Playable (FP)** | First playable version with a technical and artistic basis. |
| **Alpha** | Implements all essential functionalities and most assets. |
| **Beta / Release Candidate** | Full featured game, free of critical bugs. |
| **Gold Master** | Final version certified and ready for distribution. |

### Post-production
| Element | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Maintenance** | Bug fixes, balancing, optimization, online support. |
| **DLC (Downloadable Content)** | Additional downloadable content (skins, expansions). |
